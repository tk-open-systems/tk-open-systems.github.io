					<description><![CDATA[<p>TkOS engineer Baruch Siach recently completed the bring-up for SolidRun's i.MX8M based system-on-module (SOM) products that are based on NXP’s latest i.MX8M system-on-chip (SoC) that offers a range of features for embedded and IoT multimedia solutions. 4K UltraHD + HDR, 20 audio channels and Dolby Vision. This project included modifications to the U-Boot bootloader and the mainline Linux kernel. The project was completed with minimal time and effort thanks to support from SolidRun's excellent hardware design team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In November 2017 we completed a Linux kernel and root filesystem for the Beagleboard Black for an Israeli startup firm in the intelligent garment sector.</p>
<p>The gadget allows Windows, Android or Linux devices to browse the files on the gadget, even while the gadget might be using those same files. The work that we did involve a forward port of Canonical&#8217;s &#8220;MTP Responder&#8221; project that relies on Amit Pundir&#8217;s RFC-1-2-usb-gadget-configfs-add-MTP-function.diff Linux kernel patch, to the latest mainline kernel sources to both the x86 and ARM architectures.</p>

<p>We integrated the currently under-development V4L2 driver for the RK3288 camera interface that integrates ISP functionality and wrote a V4L2 compliant sensor driver for a new camera sensor.</p>
<p>We configured and integrated the MIPI-CSI video data transport over serial coax medium using TI FPD-Link protocol serializer chip and the deserializer on the RK3288 SoC.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>TkOS Announces Encrypted Media Solution using Freescale's High Assurance Boot (HABv4) encryption and authentication capabilities to provide fully encrypted boot media for embedded platforms using Freescale's i.MX system-on-chips (SoC's).  With this solution, you can securely encrypt the boot loader and the entire operating system on an embedded device. The solution can also be configured to provide protection against booting unauthorized operating system images and updates.  Tk Open Systems developed the Encrypted Media Solution with the assistance of Freescale who provided access to proprietary information regarding HABv4. Using Tk Open System's Encrypted Media Solution allows you to distribute application updates over the Internet, with the highest level of assurance that the media will not be decrypted.</p>
